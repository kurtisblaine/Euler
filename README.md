## Branch Hierarchy

The Production branch is for production ready code. Nobody is allowed to push directly to it.

The Develop branch is for all developer changes. Everyone can push directly to it. This is the branch that gets all changes merged to Production if there are no Xcode build errors and if it's stable.
